# MNIST-with-TensorFlow-Keras-and-deep-learning

The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network that recognizes handwritten digits and further enhance the neural network to achieve 99% accuracy. Tools that deep learning professionals use to train models efficiently like TensorFlow and Keras are used for this project.

A neural network with multiple layers is explored. A learning rate schedule is applied. A convolutional neural network is used to leverage more dimensions. Regularisation techniques like dropout and batch normalization are applied. The neural network also accounts for overfitting.

The MNIST dataset, a collection of 60,000 labeled digits is used.
